Step,Description
1. Define Evaluation Dimensions,"Use five core dimensions: Linguistic Proximity, Ethical Function Overlap, Layer Alignment Match, Philosophical Coherence, Corpus Co-occurrence."
2. Assign Scores (0–1),Rate each canonical value against the new cognate across all dimensions.
3. Compute Weighted Mean,Combine scores equally or by priority weighting to find the highest alignment score.
4. NLP Embedding Comparison,Optionally use BERT or RoBERTa cosine similarity between definitions.
5. Interpret Scores,>= 0.75: Auto-assign canonical; 0.60–0.75: Flag for human review; < 0.60: Redefine or reassess term.
6. Assign Canonical Value,Map the cognate to the canonical value with highest validated score.
Example – Agency,Scores highest (0.89 est.) with Autonomy across dimensions. Assigned to canonical_value_override = autonomy.
