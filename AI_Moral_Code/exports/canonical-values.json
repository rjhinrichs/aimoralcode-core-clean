It requires that data flows, algorithms, institutional logic, and outcomes are not hidden behind obfuscation or complexity. In moral terms, it serves as a prerequisite for informed consent, accountability, and meaningful oversight.\n\nAI Ethics Implications:\nIn AI systems, transparency enables:\n\nInterpretability of algorithmic decisions\n\nAuditing of system behavior and outcomes\n\nDetection of bias, drift, or misuse\n\nDemocratization of knowledge, reducing power imbalances between developers, regulators, and users\nIt is often operationalized through explainable AI (XAI), documentation standards, model cards, and transparent governance logs.",
