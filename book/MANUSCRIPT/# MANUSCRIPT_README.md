# MANUSCRIPT_README.md

## Purpose
This manuscript documents the application of the AI Moral Code to value-based moral dilemmas in the context of superintelligence, decision-making, human dignity, and ethical AI governance. It synthesizes canonical values into use-case resolutions that reveal the alignment or dissonance between AI capabilities and human ethical expectations.

## Structure
- `/moral_dilemmas/`: Contains individual dilemma prompts and structured resolutions.
- `/taxonomy_analysis/`: Maps AI Moral Code values (Core, Social, Cultural, Personal, AI, AGI) to each dilemma.
- `/case_studies/`: Evaluates ethical breaches using AI Moral Code layers across real-world incidents.
- `/conclusions/`: Extracts generalized insights and moral obligations from each dilemma.
- `/appendices/`: Supplementary reasoning models, including the Periodic Table of AI Values and Prompt-Response maps.

## Canonical Values
1. **Trust** – Foundation of relational integrity; mandates alignment between AI actions and human expectations.
2. **Accountability** – Ensures moral answerability of AI systems and their human developers.
3. **Justice** – Demands fairness in AI operations, with redress mechanisms for harm or bias.
4. **Transparency** – Requires explainability in AI decision-making to preserve scrutiny and control.
5. **Human Dignity** – Protects the intrinsic worth of all persons from AI overreach or replacement.
6. **Autonomy** – Upholds individual self-determination against manipulative or coercive AI systems.
7. **Empathy** – Embeds respect for emotional complexity, avoiding exploitation of human vulnerability.
8. **Ethical Development** – Frames AI design and deployment within principles of human welfare and sustainability.
9. **Human Flourishing** – Promotes purpose, creativity, and growth as co-evolutionary goals for humans and machines.
10. **Authenticity** – Preserves the genuine nature of human experience in contrast to AI-simulated interactions.
11. **Collaboration** – Envisions human–AI partnership rather than dominance.
12. **Sustainability** – Aligns long-term AI goals with civilizational endurance and moral foresight.

## Integration Logic
Each dilemma is evaluated through the lens of these values using a consistent format:
- **Prompt** – Framing question posed to the AI model
- **Canonical Value Mapping** – Taxonomical alignment of key ethical dimensions
- **Summarized Moral Resolution** – AI-synthesized, human-centered ethical position
- **Governance Implications** – Policy or design-level interventions implied
- **Conclusion** – Value-framed insight into the broader moral stakes of the scenario

## Versioning Notes
- v1.0 includes 8 moral dilemmas, 2 case studies, and complete AI Moral Code alignment layers.
- v1.1 will add conflict alignment charts and the diagnostic disvalue response framework.
- v2.0 will support integration with AIBQ (AI-Based Inquiry) for real-time moral querying and resolution tracking.

## Use Case
This manuscript is used by researchers, ethicists, and AI developers to:
- Evaluate moral edge cases in superintelligent behavior
- Align governance strategies with ethical imperatives
- Train AI agents on value-saturated decision-making
- Support curriculum modules in AI ethics and policy
