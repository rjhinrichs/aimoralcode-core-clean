# AI Moral Code – Master Plan

This document outlines the unified vision and roadmap for the AI Moral Code initiative. It integrates multiple workstreams across ethics, technology, policy, and publishing to create a structured and operational moral framework for AI alignment.

## Strategic Pillars

1. **Canonical Value Development**
   - Define and weight core ethical values and disvalues
   - Structure values into NRBC layers and governance functions

2. **Cognates Dictionary**
   - Map linguistic and conceptual variants across global traditions
   - Build a browsable, AI-readable glossary for ethical interoperability

3. **Disvalue Diagnostics**
   - Identify and categorize “disvalues” (ethical violations, failures, breaches)
   - Connect disvalues to their opposing canonical values for analysis and recovery

4. **Conflict Mapping**
   - Structure and simulate ethical conflict zones (e.g., autonomy vs. security)
   - Provide explainable resolution architectures for AI decision-making

5. **Tool Integration**
   - Feed structured values into AI Behavior Quotient (AIBQ) simulations
   - Export .json for front-end rendering in the Cognates Browser

6. **AI_Moral_Code_Book**
   - Manuscript-in-progress for public and academic dissemination
   - Draft chapters, supporting data, and reference analysis stored in `AI_Moral_Code_Book/`

7. **Web Architecture**
   - Host project materials, documentation, and tools using GitHub Pages
   - Support semantic search, visualization, and value comparison

8. **Immersive Deployment**
   - Future VR scaffolding for ethics training, transparency walkthroughs, and value co-creation

## GitHub Repositories

- [`aimoralcode-core`](https://github.com/rjhinrichs/aimoralcode-core): Main repo with book content, data, and planning files
- [`cognates-browser`](https://github.com/rjhinrichs/cognates-browser): React-based glossary viewer
- `aimoral-jekyll`: Web delivery/testing (optional forked site base)

## Current Priorities

- [ ] Complete README.md for all major folders
- [ ] Finalize glossary structure and disvalue export logic
- [ ] Begin draft of core book chapters
- [ ] Prepare conference-ready visualizations

This document serves as the coordination layer between research, publication, tooling, and ethical system design.
