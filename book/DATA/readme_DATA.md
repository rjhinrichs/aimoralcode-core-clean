# DATA Folder â€“ AI Moral Code Book

This folder contains structured datasets, reference tables, and analysis-ready files used throughout the AI Moral Code manuscript and supporting research.

## Purpose

To centralize and maintain all tabular and structured information critical to:

- Canonical value derivation
- Ethical principle frequency analysis
- Conflict mapping and disvalue diagnostics
- Sectoral alignment and regulatory metadata

## Common Contents

- `.csv` files from taxonomy modeling and scoring
- `.xlsx` files for manual audits or annotated weights
- `.json` files (optional) for simulation or web integrations

## Folder Usage

Each file in this directory should be clearly named, versioned, and traceable to:

- A figure, table, or appendix in the manuscript
- A statistical model or method in the research plan
- A reference framework cited in Project_Documentation.md

## Update Protocol

- New files must reflect canonical naming (e.g., `Ethical_Terms_Expanded_2025.csv`)
- Replace files via Git commit only after reviewing prior changes
- Consider splitting raw vs. processed data if project size grows
