# Cubic Moral Architecture

## A Next-Generation Ethical Simulation Model for AI Systems

The Cubic Moral Architecture introduces a three-dimensional ethical simulation framework for AI systems, enabling dynamic modeling of how moral principles evolve, interact, and adapt in context-rich environments.

### Dimensions

**X-axis: Canonical Values**  
The foundational moral drivers encoded in the AI Moral Code—e.g., Trust, Fairness, Accountability, Non-Maleficence.

**Y-axis: Cognate Expressions**  
Localized instantiations of values across cultural, sectoral, and legal contexts. These semantic variations serve as ethical reflexes in different environments.

**Z-axis: Ethical Trajectories (Outcomes)**  
The measurable behavioral, regulatory, or societal transformations that emerge when values are activated, violated, or ethically stretched. This dimension captures the evolution of AI's moral footprint over time.

### Purpose

To simulate:
- Value conflicts in situational contexts
- Disvalue emergence under system drift
- Cross-cultural shifts in value interpretation
- Regulatory adaptation and moral posture change

### Formula

**Moral State = (V_i, C_ij, T_ijk)**

Where:
- `V_i` = Canonical Value 
- `C_ij` = Cognate variant in context j
- `T_ijk` = Time-evolved ethical outcome (trajectory k)

### Use Cases

- Simulation testing in value-conflicted AI decisions
- Trajectory mapping for long-term ethical stability
- AI ethics benchmarking across jurisdictions
- Training models for moral mutation detection

### Integration with AI Moral Code

This architecture complements the NRBC framework, adding a temporal-spatial dimension to moral reasoning. It empowers synthetic conscience development, reflexive AI behavior, and foresight modeling in high-stakes environments.

### Next Step
Codify prompts for each axis transition (Value ↔ Cognate ↔ Outcome) and deploy them within your AI Simulation Layer as test heuristics aligned with core governance mechanisms.
