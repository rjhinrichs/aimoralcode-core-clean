# AI Moral Code Book

This folder serves as the central workspace for the manuscript, research data, presentation decks, and source materials comprising the book project: *The AI Moral Code*.

Each subfolder is intentionally organized to reflect a clean separation of concerns between manuscript content, evidence, supporting data, and archival material.

## Folder Structure

### `MANUSCRIPT/`
- All `.docx` files that are part of the official book draft
- Includes titled manuscript, draft chapters, structured writing sections
- Working documents that are versioned alongside the canonical repository

### `PRESENTATIONS/`
- Slide decks used for public talks, workshops, or conference presentations
- Formats include `.pptx`, `.key`, and presentation-ready `.pdf`

### `DATA/`
- Structured data files directly tied to content or figures in the book
- Includes `.xlsx`, `.csv`, `.json` datasets used for:
  - Glossary frequency analysis
  - Canonical value scoring
  - Taxonomy and term tracking

### `SOURCES/`
- Academic references, source PDFs, white papers, and external citation material
- Includes scanned readings or original materials cited throughout the text

### `ARCHIVE/`
- Older drafts, exploratory fragments, and retired documents
- Unstructured early work that may be referenced but not actively edited

This structure supports modular publishing, reproducible documentation, and long-term maintainability of the book project.
