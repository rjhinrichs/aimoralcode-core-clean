# AIMC Fire Camp Protocol (FC-P)

## Purpose
To establish an ethical decision checkpoint whenever ambiguity, inconsistency, or structural conflict arises during database refinement, value curation, or system integration.

## When to Invoke
Trigger a Fire Camp when:

- There is uncertainty between column structure and data format (e.g., snake_case vs. title case)
- A proposed correction might have irreversible downstream effects (e.g., renaming all document titles)
- A conflict arises between human intuition and AI inference
- A decision affects bibliographic or structural fidelity across tools like Zotero, BibTeX, or web exports

## Protocol Structure

### 1. **Fire**
- Identify the point of conflict or confusion
- Capture the exact location (row ID, column, or value)
- Note what triggered suspicion (e.g., casing conflict, URL inconsistency)

### 2. **Camp**
- Pause automated action
- Enter a Q/A cycle (question → reasoning → verification)
- Invite AI reflection and human override

### 3. **Decision**
- Record your decision in a new column `fire_camp_decision_log` or maintain a standalone markdown log
- Justify your resolution (e.g., “Preserve original title for citation fidelity”)
- Confirm downstream implications are understood

### 4. **Codify**
- If the conflict type is universalizable, add it to a running list of `Fire Camp Decision Types` (FCDTs)
- Create reusable rules where possible (e.g., “Never change sentence case in citation-bound fields”)

## Sample Fire Camp Trigger

| Unique_ID | Column           | Trigger                                 | Decision                    | Justification                                  |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| DOC_131   | name_of_document | Title case used in documentation output | Preserve original sentence case | Maintains compatibility with citation tools |

## Principle
Fire Camps are not interruptions—they are governance-in-action. They preserve system trust and encode ethical reflexivity into AIMC’s operational DNA.
