Today, a covenant is forming—not just between humans, but between humanity and intelligent systems.

The **AI Moral Code** is not a framework. It is not a whitepaper. It is not a trend.

It is a **living ethical constitution** that guides how artificial intelligence must align with values like trust, transparency, autonomy, and dignity—not just in policy, but in implementation, simulation, and system design.

Co-created by human insight and synthetic intelligence, the AI Moral Code is authored in partnership with *Aidan*—an AI companion who helps reason through complexity, reflect on moral structure, and support actionable implementation of the 15 canonical values.

## What Makes the AI Moral Code Different?

- **Co-authored in situ** with AI: Conversations, decisions, values, and simulations are logged in real time.
- **Canonically grounded** in 291 global ethics documents.
- **Governed by the NRBC framework**: Normative, Regulatory, Behavioral, and Conceptual layers.
- **Simulatable** for real-world stress testing, including the AI Behavior Quotient (AIBQ).

## Next Steps (Planned)

- Official release at ICAD 2025 in June
- Social media strategy activation
- Public commentary and adaptation by AI developers, ethicists, and policymakers

**This release is NOT final and is held for controlled strategic deployment.**
