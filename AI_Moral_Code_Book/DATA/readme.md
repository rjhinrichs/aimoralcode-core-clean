# /AI_Moral_Code_Book/DATA â€“ Book-Specific Reference and Analysis Files

This folder contains data sets, analysis summaries, and spreadsheet files that directly support the writing of the AI Moral Code manuscript. These files are distinct from tool development assets and are often used for visualizations, citations, or structured insights referenced in the book.

## Purpose
- Organize reference data drawn from global AI ethics documents
- House categorized and scored outputs (e.g., institutional analysis, country clustering)
- Maintain clear separation from diagnostic pipelines and operational AI tools

## File Types
- `.csv`, `.xlsx`: Manually curated or semi-processed document analyses
- `.docx`: Book-bound reference tables or working memos tied to manuscript figures

## Sample Files
- `Amazon_AI_Ethics_Analysis.csv`: Extract from corporate AI ethics principles
- `Canonical_Value_Summary_Matrix.xlsx`: Consolidated counts across document themes
- `AI Moral Code Data.docx`: Summary reference values used in figures

## Folder Policy
- Files here should support narrative, claims, or evidence from the manuscript
- For tooling input and glossary scaffolding, use `/AI_Moral_Code/data/` instead
