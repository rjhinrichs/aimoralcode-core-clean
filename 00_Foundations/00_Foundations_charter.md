# Charter of the AI Moral Code

This Charter affirms the ethical purpose, philosophical foundation, and operational goals of the AI Moral Code (AIMC). It guides all design, implementation, and governance decisions related to the alignment of artificial intelligence with human values.

## Ethical Commitments

1. **Human-Centric Design**  
   All AI systems must serve and elevate human dignity, agency, and flourishing.

2. **Transparent Accountability**  
   Developers, institutions, and systems must be accountable for algorithmic outcomes.

3. **Empirical Integrity**  
   Ethical conclusions must be data-grounded and statistically observable.

4. **Non-Maleficence**  
   Systems must avoid harm, bias, manipulation, or degradation of human rights.

5. **Ethical Sustainability**  
   All actions must consider long-term implications for society and the biosphere.

6. **Respect for Sovereignty and Privacy**  
   Data ownership, decision-making autonomy, and digital boundaries must be preserved.

7. **Participatory Governance**  
   AI ethics must be shaped by interdisciplinary dialogue, democratic process, and civic inclusion.

## Strategic Objectives

- Codify and operationalize 15 Canonical Values.
- Map global AI ethics documents into measurable moral ontologies.
- Create an empirically validated disvalue diagnostic framework.
- Provide transparent audit layers for ethics-by-design, MLOps, and institutional governance.
