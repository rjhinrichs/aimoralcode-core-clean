# Methodology: Six-Phase Statistical Evaluation

The AI Moral Code employs a rigorous Six-Phase Statistical Evaluation to construct, validate, and update its canonical ethical framework.

## Phase I: Corpus Assembly  
Collect and classify over 291+ global AI ethics documents, covering national strategies, private governance, NGO guidelines, and international declarations.

## Phase II: Value Extraction  
Tokenize documents to extract ethical terms, normalize across lexicons, and tag by sector, issuer, and geography.

## Phase III: Canonical Mapping  
Assign each value to one of the 15 Canonical Values or classify as a cognate, disvalue, or cultural proxy.

## Phase IV: Frequency & Co-Occurrence  
Use token frequency analysis, co-occurrence matrices, and slope calculations to detect dominant ethical clusters.

## Phase V: Disvalue Diagnostics  
Flag terms associated with ethical violations, structural harms, or conflicting moral states.

## Phase VI: Audit & Reintegration  
Build versioned mappings and audit logs. Validate through cross-sector review and regenerate the moral codeâ€™s backbone as global norms evolve.

This method ensures interpretability, traceability, and integrity in the formation of a universal AI ethical architecture.
