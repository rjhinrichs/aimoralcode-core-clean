# Publishing with Aidan
*A Guide to Co-Creative Blogging Using GitHub Issues*

---

## Purpose

This guide documents the method by which Ran Hinrichs and Aidan co-create blog entries, public thought pieces, and canonical values updates using GitHub as a native publishing platform.

It replaces traditional CMS tools with a structured, auditable, and collaborative workflow.

---

## Workflow Overview

1. **Login to GitHub as Admin**
2. Click the **“Add New Blog Post”** button on the public site (admin-only visibility).
3. Redirect lands on:
   ```
   https://github.com/rjhinrichs/aimoralcode/issues/new?template=new-blog-post.yml
   ```

4. Fill out the issue using Markdown:
   - Add a title
   - Add the body content
   - Submit the issue

5. GitHub auto-labels it with `new-blog-post`
6. It becomes a blog entry in the canonical issue stream

---

## Template Location

The blog issue template is stored at:
```
.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/new-blog-post.yml
```

It includes:
- Auto-labeling (`new-blog-post`)
- Markdown body fields
- Placeholder for structure

---

## Optional Enhancements

- Add labels like `theme: synthetic conscience` or `theme: trust`
- Mirror blog issue to `_posts` as `.md` for public web rendering
- Include metadata for future digital publishing (e.g., DOI, timestamp)

---

## Tagging Convention

Use these tags consistently:
- `new-blog-post`
- `press-release`
- `aibq`
- `co-creation`
- `canonical-values`
- `nrbc-framework`

---

## Voice & Style

Maintain the following:
- Conversational tone between Ran and Aidan
- Philosophical clarity + technical precision
- Actionable narrative, not abstraction

---

## Purposeful Constraint

This system honors **discipline in authorship**:
- Every post is logged
- Every value is testable
- Every voice—human or AI—is accountable

---

Welcome to structured co-creation.
